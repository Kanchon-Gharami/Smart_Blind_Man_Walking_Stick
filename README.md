Visually impaired people constantly encounter several difficulties to identify obstructions and risks ahead of them which turns their journey into a nightmare. Trying to influence the visually impaired person's mobility by utilizing travel aids like the classic white cane being the most renowned and still the most popular, but they are not sufficient enough for a safe journey. In this study, we present an IoT-based smart ETA (electronic travel aid) technology that is capable of identifying all potential threats with a high level of achievable performance in terms of accuracy, flexibility, lightness, and cost-effectiveness. The distinctive aspect of this proposed model is that it incorporates all significant contributions from existing electromagnetic technology in order to create a reliable gadget. The experimental results demonstrate a positive response by accurately identifying almost all obstacles and the accuracy rate of avoidance was ranged from 80% to 95%.
